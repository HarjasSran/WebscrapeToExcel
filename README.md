# WebscrapeToExcel
This is me learning and practicing my Data Extraction and saving skill during my third day at my first Coop job at Amico Affiliates as a Junior Developer
# TO DO
As of right now, the excel file is saved locally and it adds to that only. I will need to add the fact that it should work on everyones desktop.
This will be done by using pandas to make a local file on anyones PC prior to saving onto it.
# Ultimate goal
The goal for this practice assigment is to practice my skills with Data Extraction and excel files so that I can perform a task for my coop job.
My first project is to extract data from a website that has given us access to certain data. I have to collect this data and save it as an excel file so that we can display infomration to different departments at my workplace. Since I do not yet know how to do this, I am doing a lot of learning and practicing on my own.
# Challenges
Some challenges for my end goal is to automate this process so that daily, or however frequently, my script will pull data to update the working excel file for the display. The display we are using is Power BI as it is easy to use, preceive and look at for the different departments at work.
Another challenge would be to store this data, so that we can call back on it at any point. I would have to consult with my employer and supervisor to understand exactly how we want the history to be tracked, stored and displayed on Power BI
